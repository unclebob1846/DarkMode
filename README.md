# YouNow DarkMode

## Announcement

YouNow just updated their system *2* times:
1. They removed XP for likes given to streamers.
2. They made a like only worth 5 coins as a reward.

Because of these changes the "Massliker" won't level your account up anymore and will slowly drain you coins.

*You can still use this script to accomplish some of the following:*
* Watching broadcasts and don't count as a viewer nor be listed in the viewer-list.
* Spamming into all chats of a certain tag or in the tag of the broadcaster you are currently watching.
* Obtaining informations about broadcasters they don't share in public.
* Getting a much faster and better user experience while browsing YouNow.

But finally I want to tell you some thought of me about the recent changes:

*Congratulations*, YouNow! You officially destroyed your own system.
Now the only way to level up without crazy effort is to pay for your shitty service.
Why shitty service you might ask?
* Aspect ratios of 4:3
* Broadcast Resolution of 444p
* 10FPS Videos
* <500kbps bitrates 
Your technology is as out of date as your own grandmothers.

We accomplished our goal: We spread love and you answered with hate.
You made it impossible for honest users to level up as quick as before.
New users will be bored much faster because they don't see progress and are not able to give gifts to their favorite broadcasters.
Your community will never be the same and will reduce itself to what you really want:
*Money*

This is the reason why I created this script.
Your only goal was to make as much money as possible before YouTube starts with their streaming service worldwide.
I delivered you an excuse to go full into "money-making"-mode. Have fun!

Now you can continue to grab the cash of the parents of underages.
*Congratulations*, YouNow!

And be aware: If you change anything back to how it was before: We'll be back and spread love again!
Love is much stronger than hate and we want everybody to feel loved.

XOXO Axt
